# AZ-900 Hands-On Labs Portfolio
This file contains lab walkthroughs and notes for Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900).

Welcome to my **Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) Lab Portfolio**. This repository contains practical labs that showcase foundational cloud concepts using Microsoft Azure. 

The goal of this project is to:

- Demonstrate **practical understanding** of Microsoft Azure services 
- Build hands-on experience across **compute, networking, storage, identity, security, and cost management**.

## Scenario

> Youâ€™ve recently joined a fictional company called **CloudFusion Ltd.**, a startup looking to migrate some of its operations to Microsoft Azure. As their new **Cloud Associate**, your manager assigns you a **proof-of-concept project** to demonstrate your knowledge of Azure services before the full cloud migration begins.
>
> Your goal is to build out a sandbox Azure environment that:
> - Shows how key Azure services work
> - Provides examples of secure resource deployment
> - Tracks cost and performance
> - Highlights cloud capabilities like storage hosting, IAM, and even basic AI
>
> You are tasked with completing 8 labs that mirror real-world responsibilities and document each clearly for internal review.
